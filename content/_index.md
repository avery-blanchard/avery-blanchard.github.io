## About me 
I recently (May 2023) graduated from **Columbia University**!

At Columbia, I studied Computer Science. Advised by [Professor Jason Nieh](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/), I worked on extending the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) to containers. I also worked with [Professor Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/) in the Creative Machines Lab to design software for a 3D printer. Find more details [here](https://avery-blanchard.github.io/projects).

I am broadly interested in [systems](http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utah2000/utah2000.pdf) and [security](https://xkcd.com/2385/), but I am always looking to learn new things!

See more on my [CV](https://avery-blanchard.github.io/cv)!
