# About Me

I am a 1st year Computer Science Ph.D. student at **Duke University**. In May of 2023, I graduated from **Columbia University**

At Columbia, I studied Computer Science. Advised by [Professor Jason Nieh](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/), I worked on extending the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) to containers using eBPF. I also worked with [Professor Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/) in the Creative Machines Lab to design software for a 3D printer. Find more details [here](https://avery-blanchard.github.io/projects).

I am broadly interested in systems and security, but I am always looking to learn new things.

See more on my [CV](https://avery-blanchard.github.io/cv)!
